**About this project**

This project provides a JSR-107 javax.cache implementation using Levyx Helium to provide fast, unbounded caching in SSD storage with close to in-memory performance. This is suitable for integration in Hibernate projects as a provider for the second-level cache. 
*We recommend that you familiarise yourself with the specification [JSR-107](https://github.com/jsr107) and with the relevant [Hibernate documentation](http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#caching) before use.*
